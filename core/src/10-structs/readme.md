# The Go programming Language - Structs

A struct is a sequence of named elements, or fields! Each element/field must have a name and a type. Most other resources typically make a comparison to OOP classes here. However, unlike typical, or traditional OOP Go has the ability to have structs hold complex data structures rather than a true class/Object model. There is also no inheritance.

In Go a struct is nothing more than a blueprint of the data a structure can hold. It is fixed at compile time, the structure of it is not mutable at runtime.
