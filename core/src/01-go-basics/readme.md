# The Go programming Language - Basics

[Hello World](/core/src/01-go-basics/101-hello-world) Simple and traditional programming intro. Gives the first look at the `main package` and the `fmt` package also.

[Variables](/core/src/01-go-basics/102-variables) shows the declaration of variables types between long and short forms. Type inference in Go. Also shows an intro to `fmt.Printf` for formatted text to see types and values of a variable in the program.

We can see multiple declaration styles in this sample and some of the mre elegant ones can imply that somehow they are truly related. This is not the case. Where we use a grouped declaration syntax they are still a bunch of individual variables.

With the `fmt` package we have a range of formatting options, which you can see in this snippet here.

Now that we have seen how to use variables, we need to understand the basic mathematical operator types that are used in Go. If you're familiar with any other programming language most of them should look identical.
